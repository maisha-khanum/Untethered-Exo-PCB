# Subschematics
Subschematics are purely for the organization of our schematics, and don't impact PCB layout AFAIK. You can right click the boxes in the schematic editor to open them.

There are schematics for each of our different subsystems, organized by topic. Refer to the readme in the exoMainPCB folder for explanations of these.
